# project_chpc


This project is a Python script designed to clean, analyze, and extract insights from the data in `movie_dataset.csv`. The dataset contains information such as revenues, ratings, names of actors, release years, genres, and directors for movies released between 2006 and 2016.

By analyzing the ratings, revenues, directors, and actors, we aim to determine which genres, directors, and actors are associated with higher ratings and revenues. 

This script provides valuable insights for selecting the best combination of genre, director, and actors to maximize both ratings and revenue.
